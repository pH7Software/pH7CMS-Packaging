## 🧰 Usage

## 🍳 Author

Hi You! 👋
I'm [Pierre-Henry Soria](https://pierrehenry.be). A S.U.P.E.R Passionate Belgian Software Engineer.

Love writing and reading too (mostly non-fiction books), and obviously learning new things every day.

I also post on a daily basis at [Daily Learning Habit™](https://dailylearninghabit.com), new interesting and short thoughts about what I learnt during the day or the past few days.

Finally, I'm also the author of hundreds of other [open source projects](https://github.com/pH-7?tab=repositories).


## 📜 Disclaimer

This script is only useful and can only be used by the [pH7Builder software's author](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ph7enry/) to package easily the distribution zip archive when a new version of the software is released.

It won't probably be useful for you (unless you adapt it for your own software, CMS, script, ...).
