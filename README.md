## 🍳 Author

Hi You! 👋
I'm [Pierre-Henry Soria](http://pierrehenry.be). A S.U.P.E.R Passionate Belgian Software Engineer.

Love writing and reading too (mostly non-fiction books), and obviously learning new things every day.

I also post on a daily basis at [Daily Learning Habit™](http://dailylearninghabit.com), new interesting and short thoughts about what I learnt during the day or the past few days.

Finally, I'm also the author of hundreds of other [open source projects](https://github.com/pH-7?tab=repositories).
